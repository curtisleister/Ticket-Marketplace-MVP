# CLAUDE.md — Ticket Marketplace MVP

## Project Overview

This is a Ticket Marketplace MVP — a platform for buying and selling event tickets. The repository is in its initial scaffolding phase.

## Repository Status

**Current state**: Fresh repository — no application code yet. Awaiting business plan and technical requirements to begin MVP development.

## Directory Structure

```

> This section will be updated as the project structure is built out.

## Git Workflow

- **Main development branch**: `claude/build-mvp-platform-N51Wz`
- **Default branch**: `main`
- Push with: `git push -u origin claude/build-mvp-platform-N51Wz`
- Write clear, descriptive commit messages
- Never force push or push to `main` without explicit permission

## Development Conventions (To Be Established)

The following will be defined once the tech stack is chosen and scaffolding begins:

- Language and framework
- Package manager and dependency management
- Code style and linting rules
- Testing strategy and tools
- Database and ORM
- API design patterns
- Environment variable management
- Build and deployment pipeline

## Commands Reference

> Commands will be added here as the project is scaffolded (e.g., `npm run dev`, `npm test`, `npm run build`).

## Key Conventions for AI Assistants

1. **Read before writing** — Always read existing files before modifying them.
2. **Minimal changes** — Only change what is necessary; avoid over-engineering.
3. **No secrets in code** — Never commit `.env` files, API keys, or credentials.
4. **Track work** — Use TodoWrite to plan and track multi-step tasks.
5. **Test your changes** — Run the test suite after making changes.
6. **Follow existing patterns** — Match the style and conventions already present in the codebase.
7. **Update this file** — Keep CLAUDE.md current as the project evolves.
